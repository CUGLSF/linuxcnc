# The Scorbot-ER III User's Manual (6th Edition) Appendix E states that
# motors 1-5 (joints 0-4) use optical encoders with 6 slots/revolution.
# Experimentally, the Scorbot motor control box reports 6 counts per
# revolution.
#
# The arm motors (joint 0, 1, & 2) have gearboxes with a ratio of 127.7:1.
# The wrist motors (joints 3 & 4) have gearboxes with a ratio of 65.5:1.
#
# 6 counts/motor-rev * 127.7 motor-revs/driveshaft-rev = 766.2 counts/driveshaft-rev
#
# 6 counts/motor-rev * 65.5 motor-revs/driveshaft-rev = 393 counts/driveshaft-rev
#
# Each motor then has a different transmission to actuate the joint, but
# they're all 1:1 after the gearbox on the motor.
